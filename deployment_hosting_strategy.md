## Deployment and Hosting Strategy for AlchemyOS

This document outlines the deployment and hosting strategy for AlchemyOS.

### Hosting

- **Frontend (UI):** The Next.js frontend will be hosted on **Vercel**. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with Next.js. It provides a seamless deployment experience with features like automatic deployments, SSL, and a global CDN.

- **Backend (Workflow API):** The Python FastAPI backend will be hosted on **AWS**. We will use a combination of AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and security:
  - **Amazon EC2:** To run the FastAPI application.
  - **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL:** To host the PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension.
  - **Amazon S3:** To store raw input files and generated artifacts.
  - **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis:** To cache frequently accessed data.
  - **Amazon CloudWatch:** To monitor the application and infrastructure.

- **Orchestration (Temporal):** The Temporal cluster will be hosted on **AWS** using EC2 instances.

### CI/CD

We will use **GitHub Actions** to set up a CI/CD pipeline for both the frontend and backend. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the application whenever new code is pushed to the main branch.

- **Frontend Pipeline:**
  - On every push to `main`, the pipeline will:
    1. Install dependencies.
    2. Run linting and unit tests.
    3. Build the Next.js application.
    4. Deploy to Vercel.

- **Backend Pipeline:**
  - On every push to `main`, the pipeline will:
    1. Install dependencies.
    2. Run linting and unit tests.
    3. Build a Docker image of the FastAPI application.
    4. Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR.
    5. Deploy the new Docker image to Amazon EC2.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Vercel Analytics:** We will use Vercel Analytics to monitor the performance of the frontend.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** We will use CloudWatch to monitor the backend infrastructure and application. We will set up alarms to notify us of any issues.
- **Supabase Logs:** We will use Supabase Logs to store and analyze application logs.

### Security

- **Vercel:** Vercel provides automatic SSL and a secure connection to the frontend.
- **AWS:** We will use AWS security groups and network ACLs to secure the backend infrastructure. We will also use AWS IAM to manage access to AWS resources.
- **Auth0:** We will use Auth0 for authentication and authorization.
- **Trivy:** We will use Trivy to scan our Docker images for vulnerabilities.
