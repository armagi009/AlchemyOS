🧪 AlchemyOS: Full System Specification

🎯 ONE-LINER
AlchemyOS is an AI-native Knowledge Alchemy Factory — turning messy inputs into atomic knowledge artifacts, orchestrating them with a semi-autonomous “brain”, and broadcasting them across internal and external channels with near-zero human friction but tight human control.

🧩 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
Three cognitive layers:
1️⃣ Left-Brain — Generative Chaos: Raw input → multi-format outputs.
2️⃣ Middle-Brain — Orchestration Layer: Linking, labeling, risk checks, approval UX.
3️⃣ Right-Brain — Distribution Layer: Multi-channel push, local agent fallback, human “kill switch”.

Each layer is a modular service, orchestrated by a central Workflow Engine, all tied together by a Knowledge Graph Backbone.

⚙️ CORE CAPABILITIES
🧩 1️⃣ LEFT-BRAIN: Generative Chaos
Purpose:
Transform raw knowledge streams into high-value, multi-format content sparks.

Key Functions:

Input Connectors:
Enterprise Data: Slack, Teams, Email, Docs, Wiki.
Project Data: Jira, Confluence, Asana.
Public Context: RSS, social feeds, news.

Real-time Context: Calendar, meetings, transcripts.

AI Generators:
Quotes & Soundbites → punchy, tagged with source.
Micro-Articles → 150–500 word explainers.
Visuals/Memes → templates for image/video generation.
Lightweight Apps → specs for no-code flows (Zapier, Make).
Automations → GPT-generated reusable SOPs.
Summaries → slide decks, briefings.

Chaos Score:
Each output rated 1-10 for novelty/risk.
Humans can tune “chaos dial”.

Storage:

All artifacts versioned.
Linked to raw input.
Stored in the AlchemyOS Knowledge Graph.

🔄 2️⃣ MIDDLE-BRAIN: ORCHESTRATION LAYER
Purpose:
Connect, tag, filter, risk-check, and govern knowledge flow.

Key Functions:

Dynamic Tagging:

AI labels each artifact with:
Vibe (Serious, Satire, Urgent, Contrarian)
Half-Life (Ephemeral, Evergreen)
Topics, Stakeholders, Sensitivity
Knowledge Graph Weaving:

Graph DB links:

Similar artifacts.
Related discussion threads.
Connected actions (e.g., Jira tickets → retro quotes).

Premortem Risk Checks:

Predicts:
Compliance triggers (HIPAA, GDPR, M&A).
Reputational backlash.
Flags for auto-hold or SME override.
Workflow Engine:

Tracks:

Draft → In Review → Approved → Scheduled → Posted.

Routes:

High Chaos → SME review.
Low Chaos → Auto-approve with passive human veto.

Human Controls:

“More This”, “Less This”, “WTF?!” levers.
1-click “Panic Button” → immediate kill switch.
SME whitelists → topics that never need review.

Pulse Feedback:

Every veto triggers optional “Why?” — trains filters.
Dashboard UX:

Central feed of generated sparks.
Inline editing.
Bulk approve.
Chaos dial adjuster.
Activity log.

🚀 3️⃣ RIGHT-BRAIN: DISTRIBUTION LAYER
Purpose:
Push knowledge sparks to the right place at the right time, tuned to platform norms.

Key Functions:

Channels:

Internal: Slack, Teams, Intranet, Wiki.
External: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, Quora, GitHub, Insta, YouTube Shorts, CRM inject.

Platform Adapters:
Official APIs where feasible.
Local “Computer Agent” fallback for sites with no API.
Browser automation (Open Interpreter, Puppeteer, UI.Vision).

Formatting Rules:

Tone & structure adapt to each channel.
Threads, carousels, short videos, micro-text.

Scheduling:
Cadence rules (time of day, max posts per channel).
Staggering for multiple regions.

Shadow Feed:

Logs every push action.
“Dark feed” for compliance and audit.

Human Escape Hatches:
Mute by topic, user, time period.
Demote/unpublish.
Banlist keywords → auto-kill.

Feedback Loop:
Engagement metrics pulled back.
High performers → cloned/remixed by Left-Brain.

🧬 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH BACKBONE
Stores:
All artifacts (drafts, published, vetoed).
Source lineage.
Chaos/Vibe/Half-Life tags.
Relationship links (threads, campaigns).

Pluggable:
Built on Postgres + Vector DB (pgvector or Weaviate).
API exposes graph for other tools.

🔐 SECURITY & GOVERNANCE
Single Sign-On (SSO)
Role-based permissions:
Admins, SMEs, Approvers.
Credential vault for API keys & browser agent sessions.
Encrypted local store for cookies (if using Computer Agent).
Logs all human overrides.

🧩 PLATFORM + STACK
Layer	Suggested Tools
AI Engine	OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLM
Orchestration	LangChain, Temporal
Workflow API	Python FastAPI or Node.js
Knowledge Graph	Postgres + pgvector/Weaviate
UI	React + Next.js + Tailwind
Browser Automation	Open Interpreter, Puppeteer, UI.Vision
Hosting	Vercel/Render for UI, serverless backend
Scheduling	Celery or Temporal tasks
Auth	Auth0 / Clerk.dev
Monitoring	Supabase logs or custom logging dashboard

⚙️ INTEGRATIONS
Slack/Teams bots for input + push.
Google/Microsoft Workspace for docs, calendar.
Zapier/Make for quick no-code flows.
Webhooks for inbound triggers (e.g., Jira ticket closed).

🚩 RISKS & MITIGATIONS
Risk	Mitigation
Brand damage from rogue memes	Chaos dial + Panic Button + Whitelists
Compliance slip-ups	Premortem flags + SME override
Low signal-to-noise	Human feedback trains filters
Overload	Shadow Feed → easy to audit & adjust output velocity
API lockouts	Computer Agent fallback
Privacy	Local storage for sensitive tokens, SSO, role-based access

⚡ CORE USER ROLES
Role	Rights
Owner/Admin	Full control, sets Chaos Budget, approves SME whitelists
SME/Approver	Reviews high-risk content
Editor	Adjusts vibe, edits inline
General Employee	Can veto via Panic Button, gives passive feedback
